>>>>>> ## Contribute to projects, gain knowledge and win a T-shirt!

### What is Hacktoberfest?
> The hacktoberfest is an event held throughout October, which encourages participation in open source projects for all levels of knowledge. 

### Goals
> This year you need to open five pull requests in any public repository on GitHub [Github](https://github.com) , even though you have no issues marked with the Hacktoberfest label. 
> Your pull request does not have to be accepted for accounting, but be prepared to have your contributions accepted and continue working on the project. When you complete five pull requests, you get a T-shirt as a gift!

### Rules
> Each of the pull requests must be made between 1 and 31 October in any time zone. Spam or pull requests marked as spam are not valid.

### How to participate
* Create an account on GitHub: [Github](https://github.com);
* Follow the event to account for each of the contributions: [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/);
