## üïØ About

As a means of encouraging participation during Hacktoberfest 2018, this project targets those relatively new to the open source ecosystem and programming in general, but are eager to learn and improve their creative skills by contributing to projects on GitHub.

By creating issues that require easy to complete tasks, we are providing a platform where beginners can readily join the open source movement without being overwhelmed with the restrictions and complexities that plague already established open source projects. We hope that contributors will continue to  confidence as they continue to contribute to this project.

Welcome to the world of Open Source.

## üìë Getting Started

Aiming to be very beginner friendly and to advocate simplicity and clarity, these instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Fork this repository and get started.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rules

* Use Pull requests, do not commit to the Master branch or we risk running into conflicting commits.  
* Changes must be confirmed.
* Project maintainers will be in charge of monitoring issues, reviewing submitted patches and merging pull requests.
* Member contributors will be responsible for collaborating with external contributors to tackle project issues and submit patches via pull requests.
* Please update this readme as needed.

## üí° What Is Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is an event celebrated in October by Github and DigitalOcean based on the German festivity Oktoberfest.
The main purpose of this event is to stimulate open source contributions on Github by rewarding users tha participate with at least 5 Pull Requests with a T-Shirt.

### üòÑ Participation Details

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you‚Äôre welcome to participate.
Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects. As long as the project is public and GitHub-hosted, your PRs will count towards your participation
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your PRs to count.

### ‚ùáÔ∏è‚ùáÔ∏è‚ùáÔ∏è Participation Rules

To get a shirt, you must make five pull requests (PRs) between October 1‚Äì31 in any timezone. PRs can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The PR must contain commits you made yourself. PRs reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won‚Äôt count towards the shirt. This year, the first 50,000 of you can earn a T-shirt (compared with 30,000 in 2017).

### üèÉüèÉüèÉ Completions

Quality Standards
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, Quality is key), we have provided examples of the quality standards we encourage. This applies mainly to beginners.

- PRs that are automated e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace / optimize images.
- PRs that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR.
- PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October.
Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not cool.
